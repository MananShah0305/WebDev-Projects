                <div class='description'>Description: Told over the course of a single evening, The Dinner begins
                    with
                    couple Paul and Claire meeting to discuss their children’s future with Paul’s brother and his
                    wife —
                    who also happen to be prominent political figures. However, the nature of the discussion isn’t
                    college admissions or career choices, but something much more sinister. This taut novel sheds
                    light
                    on European sensibilities, complex family dynamics, and how far people are willing to go for
                    those
                    they love.

                    Sampere is introduced to The Shadow of the Wind, a mysterious and beautiful volume from his
                    father’s
                    enormous library. Daniel falls in love with the story; however, when he attempts to find more of

                    author’s work, he realizes it’s being systematically destroyed. Now Daniel’s quest isn’t just to
                    find these books, but to save them… no matter what the cost. A somewhat nontraditional suspense
                    novel, you’ll nevertheless be riveted by Daniel’s magical journey.</div>

                    of all time, but also one of the most suspenseful; as in Misery, King builds up to the climax

                    tense, psychologically revealing scenes between Lecter and Starling, which would later be
                    immortalized in the 1991 film.</div>

                    a
                    children’s nursery rhyme — they realize that this is no vacation, but a collective execution.

                    determine who among them is the killer… before their time runs out.</div>
